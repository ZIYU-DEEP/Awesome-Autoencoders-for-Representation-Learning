# Awesome Autoencoder for Representation Learning [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
*Last updated on October 20, 2020.*  
<br>

## Introduction
The **bottlenecked** nature empowered autoencoder-based models (AEs) the ability to learn features of input data; the **unsupervised** and 
**generative** nature of AEs further facilitate the generalizability of the learned features, which is particularly useful in the scenario when unlabeled data is abundant whereas labeled data is scarce.  

Down to a science, the future of machine learning to solve real-world tasks is likely to be generative models (to pretrain) followed by discriminative models (to predict). AEs (especially its variational families), as an important member of generative models, thus becomes crucial to study.  
 
In this curated list of literature review, we will focus on recent (1) theories to understand the learning ability and characteristics of autoencoders, (2) models and applications exploiting autoencoders for representation learning and downstream tasks, and (3) adversarial attacks and defenses for autoencoders (we include this topic here, as it is important to reveal some crutial nature (e.g. robustness, smoothness, manifold properies etc.) of the latent space of AEs). We may also include some not so autoencoder relavant but representation learning relavant papers in this list.   

The list is organized as follows:  
- [Survey](#Survey)  
- [Theory](#Theory)  
- [Models](#Models) 
- [Applications](#Applications) (Here we are specifically interested in applications using encoder outputs for downstream task.)    
- [Attacks on Autoencoders](#Attacks)   
- [Defense by Autoencoders](#Defenses)  
- [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous)  

In each section, papers are primarily organized by topic, then by conferences, lastly by chronological order. A short summary will be accompanied below the paper if necessary. üßëüèª‚ÄçüöÄ denotes important papers from my own perspective. üê£ refers to the ones I haven't read but they look interesting, and would be added a summary below later.

*Preprint, 2020*  
> This paper uses autoencoders to do defense. The assumption is that adversarial example do not lie on the  **manifold of true data**. The paper then uses autoencoders to find such manifold (i.e. using its latent space to approximate the manifold).   
> It needs to be note that, this approach can be vulnerable, especially when the latent spaces learnt by autoencoders deviate from true data manifold.   
> Reminds me of adding constraints on AEs for better approximation for data manifold.

*ICIP, 2020*  
> A short paper discusses the existence of robustness in autoencoder models (evaluated by classification performance). The central idea seems to be a bit shallow, but still important: AEs learn less discriminative features, enabling them to be more robust.

> Traditional undertanding is that there exists a tradeoff between robust error (i.e. perturbed worst-case ones) and standard error (i.e. unperturbed ones). This paper suggests that this tradeoff can be well mitigated, i.e. we can improve robust error and standard error at the same time.
